-- QUESTION: DO NON-DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHER VISA COST?

-- RESULT: In general, nondemocratic countries take around around 3x or more working days on average to afford each type of visa. Furthermore, the avg gdp in nondemocratic countries are 2x lower than that of democratic countries. Perhaps the average working wage in nondemocratic countries are on average lower than that of democratic countries, therefore requiring workers from nondemocratic countries to work much longer
