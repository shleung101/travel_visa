# Travel Visa

The Travel Visa Project was created to explore possible trends between travels visas,  country political climate, and gdp. 

A travel visa is a conditional authorization granted by a territory to a foreigner, allowing them to enter, remain within, or to leave that territory. In this project, we have 6 different types of visas: work, business, family reunification, student, and other. The data includes visa cost (in USD) and days worked to afford the visa with local currency/wage for each type of visa cost. 

Additionally, we have included a political rights index, electoral democracy indicator, and gdp. 

The political rights index was created by Freedom House for every country, ranging from 1 (strong political rights) to 7 (weak political rights). A country with strong political rights allows an individual to participate in the civil and political life of the society and state without fear of discrimination or repression, and is tied closely to citizenship status. Such rights include not only the right to vote in an election, but also the rights to join a political party; run for office; and participate freely in political rallies, events, or protests. The indicator for electoral democracy is 1 for existing democracy and 0 for no electoral democracy and the gdp value is in USD.
